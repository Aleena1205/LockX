        <h1>What is Deadlock?</h1>
        <p>A deadlock is a situation where a set of processes become permanently blocked because each process is waiting for a resource that another process is holding. This prevents further execution of the processes, leading to a system halt if not resolved.</p>
        
        <h2>ðŸ“Œ Four Necessary Conditions for Deadlock</h2>
        <p>For a deadlock to occur, the following four conditions must hold simultaneously:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mutual Exclusion:</strong> Only one process can use a resource at a time. If another process requests the resource, it must wait until the resource is released.</li>
            <li><strong>Hold and Wait:</strong> A process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes.</li>
            <li><strong>No Preemption:</strong> A resource cannot be forcibly removed from a process; it must be released voluntarily.</li>
            <li><strong>Circular Wait:</strong> A set of processes form a circular chain where each process is waiting for a resource that the next process in the chain holds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a cycle is detected in the <strong>Wait-For Graph (WFG)</strong>, a deadlock is confirmed.</p>

        <h2>ðŸ›‘ How Deadlocks Occur</h2>
        <p>Deadlocks often occur in multi-processing systems, databases, and distributed systems where multiple processes share resources. Common scenarios include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two processes each holding a resource and waiting for the other to release its resource.</li>
            <li>Multiple transactions in a database trying to lock the same records.</li>
            <li>Threads in a multi-threaded program waiting for shared variables or memory.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ðŸ”Ž Deadlock Detection</h2>
        <p>Deadlocks can be detected using graph-based techniques:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resource Allocation Graph (RAG):</strong> Represents processes and resources with edges indicating allocation and requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Wait-For Graph (WFG):</strong> A simplified RAG that only tracks dependencies among processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cycle Detection Algorithms:</strong> Depth-First Search (DFS) or algorithms like Banker's Algorithm can be used to identify circular dependencies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>âœ… Deadlock Prevention Techniques</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resource Hierarchies:</strong> Assigning a fixed order to resource allocation to prevent circular wait.</li>
            <li><strong>Request-All-At-Once:</strong> Ensuring a process requests all needed resources at the start to avoid hold and wait.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeouts:</strong> Setting time limits on resource holding to break potential deadlocks.</li>
            <li><strong>Process Prioritization:</strong> Allowing high-priority processes to preempt resources from lower-priority processes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ðŸ”„ Deadlock Recovery Strategies</h2>
        <p>If a deadlock is detected, the system can recover using one of the following methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Process Termination:</strong> Killing one or more processes to break the circular dependency.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Preemption:</strong> Forcing processes to release resources and restarting them later.</li>
            <li><strong>Rollback:</strong> Reverting processes to a previous safe state.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ðŸ’¡ Real-World Examples of Deadlock</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Database Deadlocks:</strong> Two transactions waiting for locks on the same records.</li>
            <li><strong>Multithreading:</strong> Two threads holding locks and waiting for each other to release them.</li>
            <li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Two or more processes waiting for I/O resources like printers or disk drives.</li>
        </ul>
